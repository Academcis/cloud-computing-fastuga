<h1>Project Description:</h1>

<p>
This project focuses on the orchestration, deployment, and management of a distributed application
using <strong>cloud-native technologies</strong>. The main goal was to provision infrastructure and
deploy a microservices-based application using <strong>Kubernetes</strong> and
<strong>Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)</strong>.
</p>

<p>
The application selected for this project is <a href="https://github.com/Academcis/fastuga-dad-ipleiria">Fastuga</a>, originally developed in the
Distributed Applications Development curricular unit at IPLeiria. Fastuga is a restaurant ordering
system that allows customers to place prepaid orders, track order status, and receive real-time
notifications throughout the order lifecycle.
</p>

<p>
For this project, Fastuga was adapted to a <strong>cloud-native architecture</strong>, decomposed
into multiple microservices and deployed using containerization and orchestration technologies.
The solution was first implemented locally using Docker and Kubernetes and later migrated to a
cloud-based cluster.
